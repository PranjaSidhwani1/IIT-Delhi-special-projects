            536 West 29th Street is a one-of-a-kind architectural masterpiece for the most discerning. Awe-inspiring, and with a perfect mix of authentic, old New York and modern trappings, this reimagined warehouse and trophy property offers endless possibilities for expansion or future development with additional FAR, all at the nexus of bustling Hudson Yards and West Chelsea&#39;s vibrant art gallery district. 
Presently set up as the executive headquarters and a client entertaining venue for a financial services firm, 536 W 29 flows with various open working spaces, a creative studio workshop, atrium, glass-cubed conference room, great room, chef&#39;s kitchen, library with rooftop access, mature planted Zen garden, and a large southern-facing terrace.  With limitless potential, the property can readily accommodate commercial/office use for companies of influence, creative powerhouses, impressive art galleries, foundations, institutions, offices or private studios. Residentially, it could convert to the most creative of private mansions, or hybrid office with a residential penthouse.
Currently built at ~ 6,500 SF (25&#39; x 65&#39; on a 100&#39; lot), with the potential for additional buildable rights up to 18,510 SF, this striking building holds two separate entrances on West 29th Street, allowing for separate galleries for executive and middle-management, two separated businesses, or otherwise seamless live â€“ work accommodation. 
Two massive great rooms showcase ceilings heights of 32&#39; and 19&#39; across an impressive and column-free 25-foot-wide building structure, generously illuminated by oversized windows and skylights throughout. Floor-to-ceiling steel casement windows that overlook a tranquil south-facing private garden are accentuated by 22&#39; tall corten steel walls and a centerpiece Cherry Blossom tree. Exposed original architectural elements throughout add to the property&#39;s incomparable character and charm, creating the ultimate urban oasis in the middle of one of Manhattan&#39;s most exciting and continuously evolving locations.
Beloved West Chelsea/Hudson Yards is home to tech behemoths Meta, Google, Amazon, and is the center of New York&#39;s booming TAMI sector (Technology, Advertising, Media and Information) housing, Warner Bros, Vayner Media, Sidewalk Labs, Intersection. Financial, legal and consulting powerhouses have recently relocated, too, including BlackRock, KKR, Wells Fargo, Silver Lake, Third Point, Intercept, Milbank, Point72 Asset Management, MarketAxess, DNB, Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner and Cooley. Shops at Hudson Yards, as well as a newly opened Whole Foods, Equinox Hotel, and multiple restaurants including Mercado Little Spain by Michelin-starred Chef Jos Andres, by Estiatorio Milos by Costas Spiliadis and Marcus Samuelsson&#39;s new Hav &amp; Mar at the Starrett-Lehigh Building. 
Moments from all this action, but quietly tucked away on a side street at the gateway to West Chelsea&#39;s art district, 536 West 29th Street is the perfect trophy building to make a Manhattan power statement even amongst the biggest and most influential.
